        <p class="lust">Happy Birthday, Fiona â€”my Persephone, my darkness in every season.

From the moment you walked into my life, you've brought warmth, grace, and a kind of beauty I never thought I'd be lucky enough to experience. You are the soft calm in my chaos, the smile that brightens even my darkest days, and the muse behind every evil intent of my heart.
<p class="lust">
Watching you grow, dream, and shineâ€”especially as we walk these university halls at different pacesâ€”reminds me every day just how special you are. You inspire me to be better, to love harder, and to never take a single moment with you for granted.</p>

<p class="lust">I celebrate you today not just because itâ€™s your birthday, but because the world truly became more beautiful the day you were born. May this year wrap you in peace, surround you with joy, and whisper all your heartâ€™s desires into reality.

Hereâ€™s to many more birthdays â€”each one sweeter than the last.

With all the love in my heart,
Your biggest fan, your proud Ephraim.</p>
